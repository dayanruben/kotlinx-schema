 * Base context for introspection that maintains state and provides common utilities.
 *
 * This abstraction extracts common patterns from Reflection, KSP, and potential
 * Serialization introspectors, including:
 * - State management (discovered nodes, visiting set, type cache)
 * - Cycle detection lifecycle
 * - Type resolution patterns
 *
 * Type parameters:
 * - TDecl: Declaration type (KClass, KSClassDeclaration, SerialDescriptor)
 * - TType: Type usage type (KType, KSType, SerialDescriptor)
 *
 * Note: For kotlinx.serialization, SerialDescriptor serves as both declaration and type,
 * so both type parameters would be SerialDescriptor.
 *
 * @suppress Not part of public API - used internally by introspector implementations.
