## Pre-Submission Checklist
<!-- Complete before requesting review -->

### PR Size

_One of the biggest challenges in code review is PR size. Smaller PRs lead to faster reviews, shorter feedback cycles,
and better code quality. Large PRs (500+ lines) are harder to review thoroughly, take longer to merge,
and increase the risk of bugs slipping through._

**Aim for PRs under 200 lines when possible.**

If your PR is large, can you split it?
- [ ] Yes, I'll create separate PRs for different concerns
- [ ] No, these changes are tightly coupled
- [ ] Maybe — I'll discuss it with reviewers first

### Documentation
- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly
